<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### Dependencies

To use this server addon, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

- [**CounterStrikeSharp**](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp/releases): CounterStrikeSharp allows you to write server plugins in C# for Counter-Strike 2/Source2/CS2
- [**K4-WorldText-API**](https://github.com/K4ryuu/K4-WorldText-API): This is a shared developer API to handle world texts (even multiline, dynamically changing and config saved ones) easily, but in the other hand end users can also use it to spawn world texts as they want and manage them per map.
- [**SharpTimer**](https://github.com/Letaryat/poor-sharptimer): SharpTimer is a "simple" Surf/KZ/Bhop/MG/Deathrun/etc. CS2 Timer plugin using CounterStrikeSharp.
